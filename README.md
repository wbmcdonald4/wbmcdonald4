# Brendan McDonald

Hey there! My name is Brendan :wave:. I'm a data/ops professional at [PartnerStack](https://partnerstack.com/), a Toronto startup that powers partner programs for software companies.

Most of the recent work that I've done is in private repositories, so there isn't much to see here.
