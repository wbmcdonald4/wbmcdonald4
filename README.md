# Brendan McDonald

Howdy! My name is Matt :wave:. I'm a data/ops professional at [PartnerStack](https://partnerstack.com/), a Toronto startup that powers partner programs for tech companies.

Unfortunately, there isn't much to see here. All of the recent work that I've done is in private repositories.
